#Problem Statement

EcoKitchen allows donors to provide meals to AIDS patients, children, elderly people and others in need. The donors can 
select the institutions and the type of meal they wish to donate and when to donate it. The meals are prepared in the kitchens 
and delivered hot and fresh to the destined locations.

The problem they have is that this entire process is manual and cumbersome. They wish to have an automated and user friendly 
system in place for the administrators, volunteers and donors.
 
#Solution
 
We propose to build web portal for them to :
* Manage users
* Make donations through online payments
* Track and update meals status
* Provide SMS and email notifications
* Share on social media platforms 

We plan to use JavaScript for the backend and web portal, Android application for volunteers and donors and Parse as a datastore.
